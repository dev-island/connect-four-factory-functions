# Connect Four Game

This project provides a simple implementation of the classic Connect Four game using JavaScript and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Overview

Connect Four is a two-player strategy game where the goal is to be the first to connect four of your own discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 6x7 grid.

## Project Setup

1. **HTML Structure**: Create an HTML file (`index.html`) to structure the game interface. Include a grid for the game board, buttons for player interaction, and a container for displaying the game status.

2. **CSS Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS to style the game elements. You can include Tailwind CSS via a CDN or set up a build process for your project.

3. **JavaScript Logic**: Implement the game logic using JavaScript. This includes creating factory functions for players, managing the game state, handling player turns, checking for wins and ties, and updating the game status.

4. **Event Handling**: Add event listeners to the game board cells and the "Reset Game" button to capture player interactions.

5. **Game Board**: Create and update the game board in the HTML using JavaScript. Update cell colors to indicate player moves.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Open `index.html` in a web browser to start the game.

2. **Gameplay**: Players take turns clicking on the columns to drop their discs. The first player to connect four discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. If the game board is full and no one has won, it's a tie.

3. **Reset Game**: Click the "Reset Game" button to start a new game.

## Development Tips

- **Modular Code**: Keep your code organized and modular. Use factory functions and separate functions for different aspects of the game.

- **Testing**: Test your game thoroughly to ensure that the game logic works correctly. Check for win conditions, ties, and edge cases.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure that your game interface is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

- **Comments**: Add comments to your code to explain the purpose of functions and logic blocks.

- **Error Handling**: Handle potential errors gracefully, such as clicking on a full column or invalid moves.

- **Accessibility**: Make your game accessible by providing appropriate HTML attributes and ensuring that screen readers can interpret the game state.

- **Optimization**: Optimize your code and consider performance, especially if you plan to expand the project.

## Additional Recommendations

To develop a Connect Four game, you'll need various functions to manage the game's logic and user interactions. Here's a list of recommended functions you should consider implementing:

1. `createPlayer(name, color)`: A factory function to create player objects with a name and disc color.

2. `createGame(player1, player2)`: A factory function to create the game instance with two players.

3. `createBoard()`: A function to dynamically generate the game board in the HTML, including grid cells and event listeners for user interactions.

4. `handleCellClick(row, col)`: A function to handle a player's move when they click on a cell. It should update the board state and check for a win or tie.

5. `checkForWin(row, col)`: A function to check if the current player has won the game by connecting four discs in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

6. `checkForTie()`: A function to check if the game has ended in a tie (the board is full).

7. `togglePlayer()`: A function to switch the current player's turn.

8. `updateGameStatus(message)`: A function to update the game status message displayed on the screen (e.g., "Player 1's Turn" or a win/tie message).

9. `resetGame()`: A function to reset the game by clearing the board, updating the game status, and preparing for a new game.

10. Event listeners: Functions to attach event listeners to the game board cells and the "Reset Game" button to capture user interactions.

11. Initialization function: A function to set up the initial game state, create players, and start the game.

12. Error handling functions (optional): Functions to handle potential errors, such as clicking on a full column or invalid moves.

13. Game over handling functions (optional): Functions to handle actions when the game is over, such as highlighting the winning discs or preventing further moves.

These functions form the core of your Connect Four game and are essential for creating a functional and enjoyable gaming experience. You can further expand and customize the game by adding features like animations, sound effects, and more, depending on your project's requirements.
